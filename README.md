# mini-bash-shell

A simple functioning **Bernie shell** written in pure C from scratch.
It's a minimal command-line interpreter that can run basic commands, change directories, read files, and more - my first attempt at understanding how shells really work under the hood.

## Installation & Usage

1. Clone the repository

```bash
